# Computer Systems Final Project

Program in C that pipes two terminal commands using pipe, fork, dup, and exec
## About

The program uses C primitives to imitate the following command on the linux terminal:
#### 
    cat sample.txt | grep 'word' 
## 
The goal of this program is to function as a page search (like ctrl+f) on any text file. 

## Goals
I wanted to make a program that functioned as a search engine for talmudic abbreviations. Lists of explained abbreviations exist on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hebrew_abbreviations).
